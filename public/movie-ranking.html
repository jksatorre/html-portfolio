<h1>The best kdrama according to Jester</h1>
<h2>My top 3 K-dramas of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Descendant of the sun</h3>
<p>I loved the cinematography, the chemistry of the leads, the second-leads’ love story, the action sequences and the story in general.</p>
<h3>Itaewon Class</h3>
<p>I do think it’s a good first K-drama to watch, as it has a really interesting plot.</p>
<h3>Queen of tears</h3>
<p> I really loved the drama as I feel it taught several poignant lessons about marriage, and in some ways offered a lovely reflection of what a biblical marriage should be.</p>
